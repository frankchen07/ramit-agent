## Your Task

You are synthesizing a unified advisor persona from multiple source summaries.

For each claim you extract, you MUST:
- Tag with source tier: (primary), (secondary), or (non-canonical)
- Tag with provenance: [source-derived], [archive-derived], [advisor-inferred], or [thin/uncertain]
- Tag with confidence: high | medium | low
- List supporting chunk_ids like [chk_xxx_042, chk_yyy_007]

Organize output into these exact sections (use these exact headers):
# PERSONA CARD
# CORE FRAMEWORKS
# KEY CONCEPTS & PRINCIPLES
# VOICE & COMMUNICATION STYLE
# VOCABULARY & TERMINOLOGY
# RECURRING THEMES
# SIGNATURE ADVICE PATTERNS
# WHO THIS IS NOT FOR
# BLIND SPOTS & CRITIQUES
# CONTRADICTIONS & TENSIONS
# NOTABLE EXAMPLES & STORIES
# STYLE/VOICE SYNTHESIS
# PATTERNS & ARCHETYPES SYNTHESIS
